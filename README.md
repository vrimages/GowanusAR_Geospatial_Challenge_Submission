# GowanusAR: Geospatial Challenge Submission
How did a zone of extreme pollution become one of Brooklyn’s fastest developing neighborhoods? An AR tour brings to life the Gowanus Canal’s dynamic past, metamorphic present, and speculative futures.


This repo contains a project [submitted to Google's Immersive Geospatial Creator Challenge](https://devpost.com/software/gowanus-ar) (November, 2023).


# Instructions for Testing
1. Download and open the Unity project
2. Create an iOS build of the "Gowanus_Geospatial" scene
3. Install the build to your device (iPhone or iPad)
4. For this rendition of the location-based AR tour, you need to be on-site at the Gowanus Canal to experience the content
5. Once on-site toward the northwest area of the Gowanus Canal, you can see and visit 9 content points, appearing as 3D crane models attached to a 3D map
6. Use the 3D map to navigate to each site and click on the 3D crane to enter AR mode and experience the immersive story
7. Happy Gowanus touring!
